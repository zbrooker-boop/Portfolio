                    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
                    <a>This term I have learnt how to code and design a website to make it more suitable for the end user. 
                        I developed this website, Zara’s Digital Experience, using my new skills in HTML/CSS. 
                        I initially planned the website in Figma, then coded it in Visual Studios, to make it functional for my users.  </a>

                    <h4>Beautiful view:</h4>
                    <img src="images/BeautifulView.png" alt="A beautiful landscape" class="Image">   
                    <a>This was my first attempt at making a website. I trialled different colours to see what 
                        was the most pleasing to the eye and I learnt how to insert an image as a background.</a>

                    <h4>Say Yes To Saving Sand:</h4>

                    <a>A challenge set in class, to create a website that would have the same output 
                        as an image given to us by the teacher. I thoroughly enjoyed this challenge, 
                        but I find finding the exact colours difficult and annoying. </a>

                    <a>The website you are currently navigating, Zara’s Digital Experience, is the 
                        culmination of all of the things I have learnt this year in Digital Technology. 
                        I’m very proud of the effort I have put in to Digital Technology this year. </a>
